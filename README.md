## BumperCars (Computer Graphics - COMP 371 - Final Project)

### Project Overview
* Developed a 3D computer game using OpenGL API
* Application consisted of a “bumper cars” game, with a user-controlled car and several other cars
* Collision detection implemented between each car
* Studied important concepts of 3D computer graphics, such as modeling, illumination, shading, texturing
* Implemented lighting and shadows by using Phong model and shadow mapping
* Familiarized with fragment shader and vertex shader programming using GLSL
